Based on the context provided, I would rate Mistral's answer as an 8 out of 10. While "fugitive" is indeed a synonym for "fugacious," it may not be the most ideal choice in this particular context. The user specifically asked for a synonym that means "lasting only for a short time." In this case, a better option might be "ephemeral."
Ephemeral ( adj. ): Lasting for a very short time; fleeting.
Therefore, my response to the user's question would be: "A synonym for 'fugacious' that means 'lasting only for a short time' is 'ephemeral.'"
