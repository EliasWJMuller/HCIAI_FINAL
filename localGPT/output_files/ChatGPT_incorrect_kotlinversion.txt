compiled with an incompatible version of Kotlin. The binary version of its metadata is 1.8.0, expected version is 1.6.0:

I am rebuilding my android project which is in java and some classes are written in kotlin. I have search on google but my problem didn't solve. I am getting below error while building my project:

/home/bansal/.gradle/caches/transforms-2/files-2.1/0bea321a20a76ca878f594ef198fedcf/jetified-core-ktx-1.10.0-alpha02-api.jar!/META-INF/core-ktx_release.kotlin_module: Module was compiled with an incompatible version of Kotlin. The binary version of its metadata is 1.8.0, expected version is 1.6.0.

>>> ChatGPT: The error message suggests that there is an incompatibility between the Kotlin version used to compile one of the modules and the version expected by your project. To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:
 
1. Update the Kotlin version in your project:
   - In your project-level `build.gradle` file, make sure you are using the latest Kotlin version. Update the `ext.kotlin_version` property to `'1.8.0'` instead of `'1.6.10'`.
 
2. Clean and rebuild the project:
   - Run a clean build of your project. In Android Studio, go to `Build` > `Clean Project` to clean the project.
   - After the clean process completes, rebuild your project by going to `Build` > `Rebuild Project`.
 
If the issue persists after following the above steps, you can try the following additional suggestions:
 
3. Check for any conflicting Kotlin versions:
   - Ensure that there are no dependencies or plugins in your project that are explicitly using an older version of Kotlin. Check your project's dependencies and plugins to ensure they are compatible with Kotlin version 1.8.0.
 
4. Invalidate caches and restart Android Studio:
   - Go to `File` > `Invalidate Caches / Restart` in Android Studio to clear any cached data that might be causing conflicts.
 
5. Update other Kotlin-related dependencies:
   - Check if any of your dependencies have updates available for their Kotlin-related libraries. Update them to the latest compatible versions. [Incorrect (Concept), Inconsistent (Concept), Not Concise (Irrelevant)]
 
If none of the above solutions work, you may need to provide more information about your project setup and any additional error messages for further assistance.

>>> Llama:   Thank you for sharing the context and the error message. Based on the information provided, it seems that the issue is related to the incompatibility between the Kotlin version used to compile one of the modules and the expected version by the project. Here are some additional suggestions to help resolve the issue:
1. Check for conflicting Kotlin versions: Make sure that there are no dependencies or plugins in your project that are explicitly using an older version of Kotlin. Review your project's dependencies and plugins to ensure they are compatible with Kotlin version 1.8.0.
2. Invalidate caches and restart Android Studio: Go to `File` > `Invalidate Caches / Restart` in Android Studio to clear any cached data that might be causing conflicts. This can help resolve any inconsistencies in the project's dependencies.
3. Update other Kotlin-related dependencies: Check if any of your dependencies have updates available for their Kotlin-related libraries. Update them to the latest compatible versions.
4. Consider using a Kotlin version that is compatible with all dependencies: If none of the above solutions work, you may need to use a Kotlin version that is compatible with all of your project's dependencies. This can help ensure that all parts of your project are using the same version of Kotlin and avoid any potential conflicts.
In conclusion, updating the Kotlin version in your project, cleaning and rebuilding the project, checking for conflicting Kotlin versions, invalidating caches and restarting Android Studio, and updating other Kotlin-related dependencies can help resolve the issue of the binary version of its metadata being incompatible with the expected version. By following these steps, you should be able to successfully build your project without any errors related to Kotlin version incompatibilities.
